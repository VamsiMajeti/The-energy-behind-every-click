Overview: The energy behind every click is a narrative driven podcast project that uncovers the invisible power consumption behind the digital world. Every search, stream & social media scroll consumes measurable energy. This work translates complex data about servers, cooling systems, AI computation & infrastructure into a clear, story based format suitable for education, awareness & environmental reflection. The project uses verified data from global institutions such as the IEA, IPCC, UNU & major corporate sustainability reports (Google, Microsoft, Amazon). The goal is to shift how people perceive the cloud not as an abstract idea, but as a living, energy hungry system that runs 24/7.

Purpose: The project aims to: Educate people about the real world energy cost of the internet. Promote awareness & responsibility in digital behavior. Encourage discussion about sustainable computing & ethical AI use. Deliver accurate, accessible science communication through calm, human narration.

Each section follows the principles of clarity, narrative flow & psychological engagement blending curiosity, contrast & reflection to sustain attention.
